# Task-Tracker-API

The Task Tracker API is a backend service that allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently through RESTful endpoints. Users can create, update, delete, and organize their tasks by priority, category, and due date. The project follows a three-layer architecture (Controller -> Service -> Repository) and implements clean, modular, and testable code.

Itâ€™s built using Spring Boot, with JPA/Hibernate for database communication and PostgreSQL as the data storage layer.
